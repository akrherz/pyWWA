AREA WEATHER UPDATE

...MESOSCALE UPDATE FOR NORTH TEXAS...

POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE SITUATION SETTING UP ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH 
TEXAS. WARM FRONT AT 1700Z WAS ANALYZED FROM CISCO TO DUBLIN TO WACO 
TO FAIRFIELD TO NORTH OF PALESTINE. FRONT WAS CONTINUING TO SURGE 
NORTH WITH SBCAPES ALREADY OVER 1000 J/KG SOUTH OF THE FRONT.

DEEP LAYER SHEAR VALUES WERE 45-55 KTS ACROSS NORTH TEXAS WITH VERY 
IMPRESSIVE LOW LEVEL SHEAR VALUES OF 30-40 KTS. CONTINUED 
DESTABILIZATION WITH SURGING WARM FRONT...LOW LCL HEIGHTS...AND 
ENHANCED SHEAR/HELICITY ALONG THE WARM FRONT WILL LEAD TO THE 
POSSIBILITY OF LONG-TRACKED TORNADOES WITH SUPERCELLS THAT CAN 
DEVELOP AND MOVE ALONG THE FRONT.

AREA OF CONCERN THROUGH ABOUT 20Z WILL BE WEST OF FORT WORTH WHERE 
SPC HAS ISSUED FIRST TORNADO WATCH. AFTER 20Z...WILL WANT TO CLOSELY 
MONITOR CONVECTIVE INITIATION NEAR THE WARM FRONT SOUTH AND 
SOUTHEAST OF DFW AREA WHERE PARAMETERS APPEARING TO COME TOGETHER 
FOR A TORNADO OUTBREAK.
