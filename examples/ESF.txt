828 PM CDT THU MAR 29 2007

...A HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL COULD CAUSE RISES ON RIVERS AND STREAMS 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND... 

AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO SLOWLY MIGRATE ACROSS THE
CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE MISSOURI VALLEY AND PRODUCE PERIODS OF
MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL ACROSS IOWA DURING THE REST OF THE WEEK
AND INTO THE WEEKEND. THE FIRST ROUND OF PRECIPITATION IS
ANTICIPATED TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT TONIGHT INTO
FRIDAY MIDDAY...WITH A SECOND ROUND EXPECTED FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL RANGE FROM AROUND A HALF
INCH TO POSSIBLY 3 INCHES ACROSS PORTIONS OF IOWA BY LATE
SATURDAY. EXCESSIVE RAINFALL...COMBINED WITH ALREADY SATURATED
SOIL AND SWOLLEN RIVERS MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL RISES OR POTENTIAL
FLOODING OF RIVERS.

THE GREATEST THREATS ARE LIKELY TO BE ALONG THE RACCOON AND DES
MOINES RIVER BASINS...BUT THE POTENTIAL EXISTS ACROSS THE
SKUNK...IOWA...AND CEDAR RIVER BASINS AS WELL. PEOPLE NEAR RIVERS
AND STREAMS SHOULD CAREFULLY MONITOR THE FORECAST ALONG THE
AFOREMENTIONED RIVER BASINS THROUGH THE WEEKEND.
