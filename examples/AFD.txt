AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TAUNTON MA
701 PM EST MON NOV 26 2012

.SYNOPSIS...

DRY WEATHER CONTINUES ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. AS FOR THE POTENTIAL
STORM FOR TOMORROW...LATEST TRENDS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ONLY A
MINOR IMPACT TO THE AREA AS LOW PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO TRACK WELL
SOUTH OF THE REGION. MUCH COLDER WEATHER IS EXPECTED BEHIND THE
STORM DURING THE END OF THE WEEK FOLLOWED BY MILDER WEATHER OVER
THE WEEKEND ALONG WITH THE RISK OF SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...

7 PM UPDATE...
DRY AIR WILL DOMINATE INITIALLY AS A QUICK MOVING HIGH WILL MOVE
ACROSS SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND. THIS WILL HELP BOTTOM OUT LOW TEMPS
MAKING IT ANOTHER CHILLY NIGHT. EXPECT LOW TEMPS TO REACH IN THE
LOW 20S IN THE NW WITH UPPER 20S ACROSS THE COAST. A FEW TEENS
MAKE SNEAK OUT ACROSS HIGHER TERRAIN IN NH. OTHERWISE CLOUD COVER
WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AS LOW PRESSURE BEGINS TO APPROACH THE
AREA. THIS CLOUD COVER MAY HELP REGULATE/INCREASE TEMPS SLIGHTLY
BY THE EXTREME EARLY MORNING HOURS. THE LOW AND ATTENDANT SHORTWAVE
IS QUICK MOVING...SO EXPECT SOME PRECIP TO SPREAD ACROSS CT AND
WESTERN MASS BY MORNING HOURS. PRECIP WILL START AS SNOW DURING
THIS TIME PERIOD AS TEMPS AND THE COLUMN IS WELL BELOW FREEZING.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...

TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT...

SYNOPSIS/GUIDANCE... 
12Z GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND
PASSAGE OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ACROSS SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND.
EXPECT THIS SYSTEM TO BE QUICK MOVING AND WITH THE LOW BEYOND THE
BENCHMARK EXPECT CT/RI AND SOUTHERN MASS TO SEE THE GREATEST
AMOUNT OF PRECIP. AS THE SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO MOVE ACROSS
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...ATTENDANT SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL BEGIN
TO DEEPEN OVERNIGHT AND CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS THE NORTH
ATLANTIC BY EARLY WED MORNING.

SPECIFICS... 
AS THE LOW PASSES TO THE SOUTH OF THE REGION EXPECT QPF VALUES TO
BE LIGHT ACROSS THE AREA WITH THE SOUTH COASTAL REGION SEEING THE
HEAVIEST AMOUNT OF PRECIP...UP TO 0.15 INCHES. THERMAL PROFILES
ARE QUITE COLD AS BEING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOW WILL DRAW IN
COOLER AIR. WITH THIS BEING SAID...PRECIPITATION WILL START OUT AS
SNOW FROM WEST TO EAST BY EARLY TUESDAY MORNING LASTING THROUGH
THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND MAINLY DIMINISHING BY EARLY WED MORNING.
AREAS CLOSER TO THE COAST WILL HAVE THE MARINE INFLUENCE...SO
TEMPS WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER. THEREFORE BELIEVE A MIX OF
RAIN/SNOW WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE SOUTH AND EAST COASTS. BY THE
OVERNIGHT HOURS WHEN SURFACE TEMPS DROP...EXPECT ALL SNOW TO OCCUR
ACROSS THE REGION. SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WILL RANGE FROM A TRACE TO UP
TO AN INCH WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS ACROSS INTERIOR CT AND RI
WHERE THE COLDEST TEMPS...HIGHER QPF...AND BETTER LIFT IS LOCATED.
AGAIN THIS IS A QUICK MOVING LOW SO HIGH SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SEEMS
TO BE LOW.

HAZARDS...
COMMUTE MAY BE SLOW GOING TUESDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE AREA WHETHER
IT IS RAIN OR SNOW FALLING. BLACK ICE IS ALSO A POTENTIAL FOR THE
OVERNIGHT HOURS ON TUES INTO WED.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...

HIGHLIGHTS...

* SHOWERS POSSIBLY LINGERING ACROSS E NEW ENGLAND INTO LATE WEDNESDAY
* HIGH PRES AND BELOW-NORMAL TEMPS EXPECTED INTO FRIDAY
* A WEAK WX DISTURBANCE AND WARMER CONDITIONS FOR THE WEEKEND
* UNCERTAINTY WITH THE FCST INTO NEXT WEEK...

DISCUSSION... 

A PROGRESSIVE FLOW REGIME IS EVIDENT FROM TELECONNECTIONS WITHIN THE 
NORTHERN HEMISPHERE RESULTING IN A SERIES OF WEAK DISTURBANCES 
FOLLOWED BY REINFORCED COLD AIR. NOTED BY PREVIOUS FORECASTERS... 
THE STRONGER -AO INDICATES A WEAKER POLAR JET ALOFT SUBSEQUENT OF 
COLDER STRATOSPHERIC AIR BUILDING S INTO THE MID-LATITUDES...WHILE A 
NEAR-NEUTRAL NAO COUPLED WITH A -PNA KEEPS A PROGRESSIVE...LOWER 
AMPLITUDE FLOW PATTERN ACROSS THE REGION. THERE IS SOME DISTINCT 
POSSIBILITY IN A SHIFT IN THIS PATTERN FOR THE EARLY HALF OF
DECEMBER BUT FOR THE LONG-TERM FORECAST AS IT STANDS NOW...THE
MAJORITY OF IT WILL BE COLD AND QUIET WITH A BRIEF WEAK
DISTURBANCE HERE AND THERE COUPLED WITH SLIGHTLY WARMER AIR.

WEDNESDAY INTO FRIDAY...

AS TUESDAY/S LOW PRES QUICKLY DEPARTS E...AN ELONGATED PIECE OF 
POLAR VORTEX ENERGY INVIGORATES AN INVERTED TROUGH TO THE REAR OF 
THE DEPARTING LOW ALONG THE E COAST OF THE NERN CONUS WITHIN THE 
BETTER BAROCLINIC REGION. WHILE SOLNS DIVERGE ON THE INVERTED TROUGH 
SETUP IN TERMS OF PLACEMENT...THERE STILL REMAINS A PLAUSIBILITY 
THAT RAIN SHOWERS COULD IMPACT THE CAPE AND ADJACENT COASTAL PLAIN 
/POSSIBLY FALLING AS SNOW SHOWERS OVER INTERIOR E NEW ENGLAND/. THE 
26/12Z NAM REMAINS THE OUTLIER...WITH THE 26/09Z SREF EXHIBITING 
SOME SUPPORT...BUT THE MAJORITY OF REMAINING GUIDANCE CONTAINS THE 
INVERTED TROUGH NW-SE THROUGH MAINE INTO THE ADJACENT GULF. WITH 
THAT BEING SAID...WILL CONTINUE WITH SLGT CHC POPS FOR E/SE NEW 
ENGLAND INTO LATE WED...MONITORING THE FETCH OFF THE WATERS /THERE 
ALSO IS THE PLAUSIBILITY OF SEEING WINDS GUSTING AROUND 15-20 MPH/. 

OTHERWISE...A SERIES OF REINFORCING COLD FRNTS WILL ANCHOR HIGH PRES 
AND COLDER AIR ACROSS THE NERN CONUS. ANTICIPATING WELL-MIXED LOW-
LVLS UP TO H85 WHERE TEMPS WILL AVERAGE AROUND -8C /MAX TEMPS AROUND 
THE LOW 40S WEDNESDAY TRANSITIONING TO VALUES AROUND THE UPPER 30S 
FOR FRIDAY/. IN ADDITION...THERE IS THE LIKELIHOOD FOR MIX-DOWN OF 
FASTER MOMENTUM AND DRIER AIR...ESPECIALLY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY... 
WITH WIND GUSTS AROUND 20 MPH /AROUND 30 MPH OVER THE WATERS/ 
RESULTING IN WIND CHILLS AROUND THE FREEZING MARK DURING THE DAY... 
FALLING AS LOW INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS OVERNIGHT. EXPECTING THE 
MAJORITY OF THE PERIOD AVERAGING OUT WITH PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS 
CONSEQUENTIAL OF REMNANT MOISTURE FRONTOGENTICALLY LIFTED BY THE 
SERIES OF COLD FRNTS. YET WITH SUCH A COLD AIRMASS...THE AMOUNT OF 
CLOUD COVER SHOULD EFFECTIVELY IMPACT SFC TEMPS THRU THE PERIOD. 

WEEKEND...

HIGH PRES ELONGATES SW-NE ACROSS THE WRN ATLANTIC RESULTING IN 
RETURN SLY FLOW AHEAD OF A WEAK SYNOPTIC DISTURBANCE ANTICIPATED FOR 
LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. ANTICIPATE AN INCREASE IN LOW-LVL FLOW 
USHERING MUCH WARMER AIR ACROSS THE REGION /H925 TEMPS AROUND -2C 
FOR SATURDAY WARMING TO AROUND +6-8C SUNDAY PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF 
THE COLD FRNT INTO MONDAY MORNING/. SATURDAY LOOKS TO BE THE BEST 
BOTH DAYS /MAX TEMPS AROUND THE LOW 40S/...WITH INCREASING CLOUDS 
LATE INTO SUNDAY /MAX TEMPS POSSIBLY AS WARM AS THE MID-UPR 50S/. A 
BROAD SWATH OF FRONTOGENETICALLY FORCED SHOWERS IS EXPECTED SUNDAY 
CONTINUING INTO MONDAY MORNING. AT PRESENT IT LOOKS LIKE THE 
MAJORITY OF THE PRECIP WILL BE IN THE FORM OF LIQUID...BUT IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO SEE A WINTRY MIX DURING THE EVENING PERIOD FOR WESTERN 
AND CENTRAL PORTIONS OF NEW ENGLAND /INCLUDING W AND CENTRAL MA INTO 
S NH/. 
 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...

HIGH PRES WITH COOLER AND DRIER CONDITIONS RETURNS TO THE NERN CONUS 
IN WAKE OF THE WEEKEND DISTURBANCE. THIS MAY BE BRIEF AS THERE ARE 
SUBTLE HINTS OF ANOTHER WEAK DISTURBANCE BY MIDWEEK WITH RETURN SLY 
FLOW...WARMER CONDITIONS...AND SHOWERY WX.

&&

.AVIATION /00Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...

FORECASTER CONFIDENCE LEVELS...
  LOW...LESS THAN 30 PERCENT 
  MODERATE...30 PERCENT TO 60 PERCENT 
  HIGH...GREATER THAN 60 PERCENT

OVERVIEW...MODERATE TO HIGH CONFIDENCE.

VFR DOMINATES INTO THE MORNING HRS. THEREAFTER WILL SEE THE ONSET
OF LOWERING CIGS TO MVFR WITH -RA/-SN WEST TO EAST. STILL SOME
UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE TIMING AND STRENGTH OF THE EXPECTANT BROAD
SWATH OF PRECIPITATION FOR THE TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT
TIMEFRAME...HAVE PREVAILED WITH A CONSERVATIVE FORECAST. IT IS
LIKELY THAT WITH -SN VSBYS MAY FALL TO IFR-VLIFR. LOWEST CIGS
WILL BE ALONG S COAST TERMINALS /MVFR-IFR/ RISING AS YOU CONTINUE
NORTH.

A FINAL NOTE...THERE ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES WORTH NOTING BASED ON
THE LATEST FORECAST GUIDANCE. ITS POSSIBLE TO SEE A BROAD INITIAL
SWATH OF SNOW WITH ACCUMULATIONS UP TO AN INCH ALONG A LINE FROM
BDL-OWD DURING THE DAY TUES...WITH A SECOND BURST POSSIBLE
OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE SE COASTAL PLAIN FROM PVD-TAN-PYM AND
ANOTHER INCH OF ACCUMULATION. TAF/S WILL BE UPDATED AND MONITORED
ACCORDINGLY SHOULD THIS POTENTIAL COME TO FRUITION. AGAIN...THE
LATEST TAF/S MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE BASIS AS THE STORM BEGINS TO
EVOLVE. WITH SNOWS...IFR- VLIFR VSBYS WILL BE POSSIBLE.

KBOS TAF...MODERATE TO HIGH CONFIDENCE. 
A CONSERVATIVE FCST. WILL SEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE INTO MIDDAY
AND OVERNIGHT WITH INITIAL -SHSN BECOMING A -RASN MIX. VSBYS
RESTRICTIONS PSBL. 

KBDL TAF...MODERATE TO HIGH CONFIDENCE.
A CONSERVATIVE FCST. CONDITIONS DETERIORATING INTO THE MORNING AS
-SN BUILDS ACROSS THE TERMINAL. EXPECTING THE WORST CONDITIONS TO
CENTER AROUND MIDDAY INTO EVNG. MAY SEE -SHSN LINGER INTO THE
EVNG. 

OUTLOOK...WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

WEDNESDAY...MODERATE TO HIGH CONFIDENCE. 

MVFR CIGS AND SCT -SHRA/-SHSN WILL LINGER ALONG EASTERN NEW ENGLAND 
INITIALLY...GRADUALLY LIFTING AND IMPROVING INTO THE EVENING PD. 
STRONGEST W/NW FLOW WITH GUSTS UP TO 20 KTS WILL BE ALONG THE 
IMMEDIATE COASTLINE.

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...MODERATE TO HIGH CONFIDENCE.

VFR. GUSTY W/NW WINDS ESPECIALLY FOR SHORELINE TERMINALS. STRONGEST 
OF WINDS WITH GUSTS UP TO 30 KTS POSSIBLE IS ANTICIPATED THURSDAY.

&&

.MARINE...

HAVE LET SEVERAL SCA GO AS WINDS HAVE DIMINISHED BELOW 25 KTS.
OUTER WATERS CONTINUE WITH SCA AS SEAS WILL BE SLOW TO RESPOND
AND DIMINISH BELOW 5FT. BELIEVE BY THE OVERNIGHT HOURS ALL SCA CAN
BE LET GO. HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH BY THE
OVERNIGHT HOURS. LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
WATERS BY TUESDAY. THIS WILL INCREASE SEAS AND WINDS BY LATE
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY WINDS. HOWEVER STILL SLIGHTLY BELOW
SCA...WILL NEED TO MONITOR CLOSELY. LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BRING
RAIN/SNOW TO THE WATERS REDUCING VSBYS.

OUTLOOK...WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

WEDNESDAY...MODERATE TO HIGH CONFIDENCE.

SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE WATERS INTO THE EVENING HOURS 
WITH W/NW WINDS GUSTING UP TO 20 KTS AS TUESDAY/S LOW EXITS EAST. 
ANTICIPATING MAINLY RAIN SHOWERS. NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF 
VISIBILITY IMPACTS...JUST LOW CLOUDS. SEAS UP TO 5 FT WILL BE 
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE OUTER WATERS WITH STRONG W/NW FLOW. SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORIES MAY BE NEEDED...ESPECIALLY FOR THE OUTER WATERS. 

THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...MODERATE TO HIGH CONFIDENCE.

CONTINUED W/NW FLOW WILL INTENSIFY...ESPECIALLY ON THURSDAY WHEN 
GALE FORCE GUSTS WILL BE POSSIBLE /LOW CONFIDENCE AT THIS TIME/. 
SEAS ACROSS THE OUTER WATERS ARE LIKELY TO SWELL TO 6 TO 8 FEET. 
WHILE A GALE WARNING IS SPECULATIVE...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES ARE 
LIKELY TO BE NECESSARY.
