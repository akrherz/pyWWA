AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE BIRMINGHAM AL
302 PM CDT THU APR 6 2006

...SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK WITH TORNADOES LIKELY FRIDAY AFTERNOON
AND FRIDAY NIGHT...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)

CONFIDENCE FOR A SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK WITH TORNADOES CONTINUES
TO INCREASE ACROSS ALABAMA.UPDATE...MESOSCALE UPDATE

MODELS IN THE SHORT TERM ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SOME 
SUBTLE DIFFERENCES. PREFER THE GFS MODEL AS IT SEEMS TO BE 
MOST CONSISTENT AND HANDLES LARGE SCALE FEATURES BEST. THE LATEST
12Z RUN CAME IN A BIT SLOWER...BUT PERHAPS STRONGER WITH THE LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL BRING SEVERE WEATHER TO THE AREA FRIDAY
AND FRIDAY NIGHT. NO BIG CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WILL 
BE MADE.

AT 245 PM CST...PARTLY SUNNY...WARM...DRY...AND TRANQUIL WEATHER
WAS OCCURRING ACROSS ALABAMA. SURFACE TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE 78
TO 83 DEGREE RANGE. MOISTURE WAS INCREASING IN THE LOW LEVELS AS
SURFACE DEWPOINTS HAD RISEN INTO THE 40S AND 50S THANKS TO
INCREASING SOUTH WINDS 10 TO 20 MPH. A LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
WAS LOCATED OVER WYOMING AND COLORADO...AND THIS SYSTEM WILL 
BRING SEVERE STORMS TO THE AREA FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.

TONIGHT SHOULD BE RATHER QUIET ACROSS ALABAMA. CLOUDS WILL
INCREASE AFTER MIDNIGHT. SOUTH WINDS BETWEEN 5 AND 10 MPH WILL
KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING TOO MUCH AS LOWS WILL BE IN THE 
50S AND LOWER 60S IN MOST AREAS WITH HIGHEST READINGS WEST. 
A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY SNEAK INTO AREAS NORTHWEST 
OF INTERSTATE 59 AFTER 2 AM CDT...SO KEPT LOW RAIN CHANCES IN 
THE FORECAST FOR THOSE AREAS...THOUGH SEVERE STORMS APPEAR TO 
BE UNLIKELY.

ON FRIDAY...LOW CLOUDS IN THE MORNING WILL MIX OUT...ALLOWING
SUNSHINE TO WARM THINGS UP NICELY. MODEL HIGH TEMPERATURES APPEAR
TO BE TOO COOL AND WILL GO ABOUT 3 DEGREES WARMER THAN THEM WITH
HIGHS BETWEEN 80 AND 85. BREEZY SOUTH WINDS 10 TO 20 MPH WITH
GUSTS UP TO 30 MPH CAN BE EXPECTED...SO SOME TYPE OF WIND OR 
LAKE WIND ADVISORY WILL BE NEEDED.

AS FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...THEY 
ARE LIKELY ACROSS THE AREA. AGREE WITH SPC DAY2 OUTLOOK WITH 
HIGH RISK ROUGHLY NORTH OF INTERSTATE 20...MODERATE RISK 
BETWEEN INTERSTATE 20 AND INTERSTATE 85....AND SLIGHT RISK SOUTH.
THE COMBINATION OF STRONG LIFT...MODERATE TO HIGH INSTABILITY...
STRONG WINDS...AND SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ALL SUPPORT 
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS.

TWO MAIN INGREDIENTS...LIFT AND INSTABILITY...APPEAR TO BE MOST
IMPRESSIVE...DEFINITELY BIGGER THAN ANY PREVIOUS SEVERE WEATHER 
OUTBREAK CENTRAL ALABAMA HAS EXPERIENCED SO FAR THIS YEAR.
THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BRING VERY IMPRESSIVE LIFT AS IT 
MOVES FROM EAST OKLAHOMA TO NORTH GEORGIA BETWEEN FRIDAY AFTERNOON
AND SATURDAY AFTERNOON. FORECAST LIFTED INDICES BETWEEN -4 AND -8 
SUGGEST MODERATE TO STRONG INSTABILITY...WHILE SURFACE BASED CAPES
BETWEEN 1500 J/KG TO 2500 J/KG INDICATE ABUNDANT ENERGY AVAILABLE
TO ENHANCE UPDRAFTS AND THUNDERSTORM STRENGTH...ESPECIALLY
COMBINED WITH A WARM MID LEVEL CAPPING INVERSON WHICH WILL FOCUS 
UPDRAFTS NEAR BOUNDARIES.

WINDS WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE STRONG...BUT NOT THE STRONGEST
THAT CENTRAL ALABAMA HAS EXPERIENCED SO FAR THIS YEAR. 850 MB
WINDS BETWEEN 35 AND 45 KTS AND 500 MB WINDS 60 TO 80 KNOTS 
WILL ALLOW FOR PLENTY OF WIND SHEAR TO SUPPORT SUPERCELL AND
MULTICELL THUNDERSTORMS. 0-3 KM HELICITY BETWEEN 250 AND 
400 M2/S2 SUPPORT ROTATING SUPERCELLS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
TORNADOES...WHICH SOME MAY BE ON THE STRONG SIDE WHEN COUPLED 
WITH THE STRONG INSTABILITY AND LIFT.

AS FOR THE EVENT...THINK SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...
WHICH SOME MAY BE LONG LIVED SUPERCELLS AND PRODUCE TORNADOES...
WILL DEVELOP NORTH OF INTERSTATE 20 AROUND 2 PM CDT AND AFFECT
THOSE AREAS...MAINLY NORTH OF A TUSCALOOSA TO BIRMINGHAM TO
ANNISTON LINE. THESE STORMS MAY BE THE MOST DANGEROUS...OCCURRING
DURING THE HEATING OF THE DAY. TORNADOES...SOME OF WHICH MAY 
BE LONG LIVED...ARE A DEFINITE CONCERN WITH THESE STORMS. 
LARGE HAIL...POSSIBLY LARGER THAN GOLF BALLS...AND DAMAGING 
WINDS UP TO 70 MPH...MAY OCCUR WITH THESE STORMS.

AFTER 9 PM CDT...BELIEVE A SQUALL LINE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP OVER CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI AS THE 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM GETS CLOSER. THIS LINE SHOULD MOVE 
ACROSS ALABAMA...AFFECTING WEST ALABAMA BETWEEN 10 PM CDT AND 
2 AM CDT...THEN EAST ALABAMA BETWEEN 2 AM CDT AND 8 AM CDT.
DAMAGING WINDS APPEAR TO BE THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS LINE...
THOUGH A FEW TORNADOES MAY OCCUR AS WELL.

THE MAIN SEVERE WEATHER THREAT SHOULD END ACROSS CENTRAL ALABAMA
BY 8 AM CDT SATURDAY AS THE SQUALL LINE MOVE EAST OF THE AREA.

SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...NORTH WINDS WILL BRING COOLER 
AIR INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE DEPARTING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. 
THERE STILL MAY BE SOME REDEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
EAST OF AN ANNISTON TO MONTGOMERY LINE BETWEEN 10 AM CDT AND 
4 PM CDT CAPABLE OF PRODUCING HAIL...THOUGH CONFIDENCE OF THIS
OCCURRING REMAINS LOW. SKIES WILL CLEAR DURING THE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING HOURS. HIGHS SHOULD MAINLY BE IN THE 70S. MUCH COOLER 
CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR SATURDAY NIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE 36 TO 46
DEGREE RANGE UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS.

SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...DRY AND COMFORTABLE WEATHER WILL PREVAIL
UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES WITH HIGHS IN
THE 70S AND LOWS IN THE 40S ARE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY) 

NO BIG CHANGES ARE NECESSARY TO THIS TIME FRAME. DRY COMFORTABLE
WEATHER WITH A SLOW WARMUP CAN BE EXPECTED MONDAY AND TUESDAY.
MOISTURE WILL INCREASE BY MIDWEEK...SO KEPT SMALL CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE
REMAINS LOW AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA MAY BE STRONGER THAN
THE GFS MODEL ADVERTISES. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN AROUND OR JUST
ABOVE NORMAL WITH HIGHS IN THE 75 TO 80 DEGREE RANGE AND LOWS IN
THE 47 TO 57 DEGREE RANGE.
