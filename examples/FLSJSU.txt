THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN SAN JUAN HAS ISSUED AN

* URBAN AND SMALL STREAM FLOOD ADVISORY FOR MINOR FLOODING OF POOR
  DRAINAGE AREAS IN
  FOR THE FOLLOWING MUNICIPALITIES...

  IN PUERTO RICO
     HATILLO...LARES...MOCA...SAN SEBASTIAN...AGUADILLA...ISABELA...
     CAMUY...AGUADA AND QUEBRADILLAS

* UNTIL 445 PM AST

* AT 152 PM AST...DOPPLER RADAR ESTIMATED VERY HEAVY RAIN IN THE   
ADVISORY AREA. RADAR ESTIMATED BETWEEN ONE AND TWO INCHES OF RAIN 
HAS FALLEN OVER THESE MUNICIPALITIES. THIS AMOUNT OF RAIN COULD 
CAUSE STREET FLOODING AND POUNDING OF WATER IN POOR DRAINAGE AREAS 
AS WELL AS RAPID RISES IN SMALL STREAMS ACROSS THE AREA. ADDITIONAL 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF AN INCH OR MORE REMAIN POSSIBLE IN THE ADVISORY 
AREA.

MOST FLOOD DEATHS OCCUR IN AUTOMOBILES. NEVER DRIVE YOUR VEHICLE INTO
AREAS WHERE THE WATER COVERS THE ROADWAY. FLOOD WATERS ARE USUALLY
DEEPER THAN THEY APPEAR. JUST ONE FOOT OF FLOWING WATER IS POWERFUL
ENOUGH TO SWEEP VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD. WHEN ENCOUNTERING FLOODED
ROADS MAKE THE SMART CHOICE...TURN AROUND...DONT DROWN.
