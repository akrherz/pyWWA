SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND TRENDS...OVER THE LAST 1-2 HOURS A MESOSCALE
BAND OF CONVECTION HAS ORIENTED ITSELF FROM ROUGHLY KEY BISCAYNE
WSW TOWARDS THE VIC OF CUTLER.  UPWIND PORTION OF THIS BAND HAS BEEN
RELATIVELY STATIONARY OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS WITH NUMEROUS OVERSHOOTING
TOPS EVIDENT IN IR IMAGERY.  EYW SOUNDING WITH PW VALUES OF 2.18" IS
SUPPORTIVE OF MULTI-SENSOR BLENDED PW ANALYSIS SHOWING PW'S ROUGHLY
AROUND 2.25" WHICH IS ROUGHLY 150% ABOVE CLIMATOLOGICAL NORMAL VALUES.
SEE VERY LITTLE CHANGE TO CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES AND OVERALL PATTERN IN
BAND SINCE THE INCREDIBLE RAINFALL REPORTS IN MFL FFW OUT OF PERRINE AREA.
THIS WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST SUGGEST THAT RAINFALL RATES OF 2.0-4.0"/HR
SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE SHORT TERM NEAR THE CUTLER AREA ON THE SHORT TERM.
AGREE WITH MOST RECENT SWOMCD THAT POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL SHOULD
CONTINUE ON THE SHORT TERM AS WEAK WARM ADVECTION  WILL CONTINUE IN
STRONG LL EASTERLY FLOW.
.
A QUICK PEAK AT THE MOST RECENT 0102Z IR IMAGE SHOWS RAPID COOLING WITH
OVERSHOOTING TOP JUST ENE OF PALMETTO BAY.  BELIEVE RAINFALL RATES WITHIN
THIS RAPIDLY COOLING CLOUD TOP AREA TO LIKELY BE IN EXCESS OF 3.0"/HR.
