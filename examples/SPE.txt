SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND TRENDS...SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING..G12
IR IMAGERY HAS SHOWN A STEADY DEVELOPMENT/INCR IN BAROCLINIC LEAF
SIGNATURE ENCOMPASSING PART OF IA/N MO/N AND W IL. THUS FAR..SFC OBS
INDICATE SNOW CONFINED TO SRN/SERN IA/N MO/W IL WITH MOST REPORTS
INDICATING LIGHT SNOW ALONG WITH MOD SNOW REPORTED AT LAMONI..LWD..AND
OTTUMWA..OTM. HOWEVER..STLT TRENDS SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL FOR AN INCREASE
IN SNOW COVERAGE AND HEAVIER RATES. G12 WV IMAGERY SHOWS AMPLIFYING
SHORT WAVE EXTENDING FM MN THRU NEB/KS..WITH STLT WIND ANALYSIS AND WV
IMAGERY ANIMATION SHOWING UPPER JET DIGGING INTO BASE OF SHORT WAVE AND
EXTENDING NEWD THRU THE OHIO VALLEY. EXPERIMENTAL GOES WV UPPR WIND AND
DIVERGENCE PRODUCT SHOWS UPPER LVL DIVERGENCE HAS BEEN INCRG OVER MO/SE
IA/IL CONFIRMS PATTERN SEEN IN WV IMAGERY ANIMATION. EXPANDING/COOLING
BAROCLINIC LEAF IS INDICATIVE OF INCREASING LIFT PROVIDED BY THE
COMBINATION OF AMPLIFYING SHORT WAVE..UPPR DIVERGENCE..AND JET DYNAMICS.
.
LEAF HAS BEEN STEADILY PROGRESSING E..WHICH IS CURRENTLY A LIMITING
FACTOR WITH REGARD TO TOTALS. HOWEVER..WITH TRENDS/PATTERN DISCUSSED
IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH WOULD EXPECT THAT COVERAGE AND INTENSITY OF SNOW
AS THE DAY WEARS ON..WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME ACCUMULATIONS OVER SE
IA/NE MO THIS MORNING..IL THIS AFTN..AND INDIANA LATE TODAY OR TONIGHT.
WHILE MO PORTION HAS THE MOST PROGRESSION WHICH SHOULD LIMIT ACCUM
THERE..BACKING OF UPPR FLOW AND LEAF BECOMING MORE SW-NE ORIENTED WITH
TIME SUGGESTS BETTER CHANCE FOR PARTS OF IL/IN THIS AFTN AND TONIGHT
AND IA/IL BORDER THIS MORNING SEEING HEAVIER AMOUNTS WITH THIS SYSTEM.
