EVENT...CURRENT CONVECTION AND OVERNIGHT POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINS
.
SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND TRENDS...CURRENTLY...COLD TOP CONVECTIVE
COMPLEX FROM NW KS TO ERN NE CONTINUING TO SLOWLY PUSH EWD AS CELLS
BUILD ON THE SWRN EDGE AND MOVE NEWD.  CURRENTLY COLDEST TOPS ARE ON
THE SWRN PORTION OF LINE WITH 0115Z/0132Z VIS SHOOTING OVERSHOOTING
TOPS OVER SMITH(-78C)/OSBORNE(-75C)/TREGO(-75C) COUNTIES IN NRN KS AND
FILLMORE(-76C) COUNTY IN SE NE.  ESTIMATING RAIN RATES WITH THESE TOPS
UP TO 1.25"-1.75"/HR.  RAIN RATES UP TO 1.0"/HR ESTIMATED WITH THE REST
OF THE CONVECTION GIVEN 0Z PW OBS AROUND 2.07" AND 0Z RAOB SOUNDINGS
SHOWING A VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE.  WITH THE TRAINING OF CELLS AND  LIGHTER
PRECIPITATION..EXPECTING THAT ANOTHER 1.5"-2.5" ARE POSSIBLE IN LOCALIZED
AREAS BEFORE THE COMPLEX MOVES OUT OF THE CURRENT AREA.
.
ON THE LONGER TERM...EXPECTING MCC TO CONTINUE ITS SLOW MOVEMENT EWD
OVERNIGHT AND SLOW DOWN EVEN FURTHER WHEN IT IS CLOSER TO SW IA/NW
MO/NE KS.  POTENTIALLY HEAVY RAINS WITH EXCESSIVE RAINS IN LOCALIZED
AREAS EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AS A COUPLE OF FACTORS LEADING TO
EXPECTED HEAVY RAINS.  WV SHOWING RIDGE STILL OVER THE PLAINS EXPECTED
TO PROVIDE DIFFLUENCE ALOFT ALONG WITH A VORT CENTER OVER CNTRL OK THAT
IS DRIFTING N THAT COULD ASLO PROVIDE SOME ENHANCEMENT TO CONVECTION.
ALSO NOTICING A LLJ ON PROFILER DATA SETTING UP RIGHT INTO THE IA/NE/KS/MO
BORDER ALONG WITH 0Z RAOBS SHOWING LITTLE SHEAR ABOVE 85H.  ALL OF THIS
COMBINED WITH A NEARLY SATURATED ATMOSPHERE WITH PW VALUES ABOVE 2.0"
PER SOUNDER/0Z OBS SHOULD ALLOW FOR GENERAL TOTALS OF 1.0"-2.0" WITH
RAIN RATES BETWEEN .75"-1.5"/HR BUT HIGHER AMOUNTS BETWEEN 3.0"-4.0"
WITH RAIN RATES UP TO 3.0"/HR POSSIBLE OVER LOCALIZED AREAS THAT SEE
MORE TRAINING AND THE HEAVIEST OF CELLS.
