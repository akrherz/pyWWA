VALID 211752Z - 211915Z

CONTINUE WW.  CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ALABAMA AND THE WESTERN FLORIDA
PANHANDLE ARE BEING MONITORED FOR A POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL WW LATER
THIS AFTERNOON

CONGLOMERATE SURFACE COLD POOL IS PROGRESSING EAST OF THE NATCHEZ/
BATON ROUGE/LAFAYETTE AREAS.  THIS FEATURE IS BECOMING A FOCUS FOR
INTENSIFYING CONVECTION...WITH ADDITIONAL SCATTERED STORMS
DEVELOPING/INCREASING IN COVERAGE AHEAD OF IT ACROSS MUCH OF
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA.  ACTIVITY IS
NOW LIKELY BASED IN MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER...WHICH IS BECOMING
INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE WITH CONTINUED INSOLATION.  THIS AIR MASS
EXTENDS EASTWARD THROUGH MUCH OF CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ALABAMA AND THE
WESTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE...WHERE CAPE MAY APPROACH 2000 J/KG BY
PEAK HEATING.

DESTABILIZATION AND FORCING/SHEAR ASSOCIATED UPSTREAM SOUTHERN
BRANCH TROUGH/JET STREAK ARE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT CONTINUED EVOLUTION
OF A LARGE CONVECTIVE CLUSTER. AS SURFACE COLD POOL STRENGTHENS...
EASTWARD ACCELERATION ACROSS SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AT 30-40+ KT
APPEARS POSSIBLE...ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASING THREAT FOR DAMAGING
WINDS. GUST FRONT MAY ADVANCE EAST OF THE EASTERN MISSISSIPPI
BORDER BY 21-22Z.
