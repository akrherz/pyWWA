...DROUGHT INFORMATION STATEMENT FOR CENTRAL ALABAMA...

SYNOPSIS...

THE LATEST U.S. DROUGHT MONITOR PLACES THE NORTHERN HALF OF ALABAMA
UNDER EITHER EXTREME OR EXCEPTIONAL DROUGHT...ROUGHLY NORTH OF A
LINE FROM ALICEVILLE TO CLANTON TO LANETT. MOST OF THE REMAINDER OF 
CENTRAL ALABAMA IS UNDER SEVERE DROUGHT. THIS INDICATES THAT THERE 
HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE DROUGHT SEVERITY OVER THE AREA 
DURING THE PAST WEEK EVEN THOUGH SOME RAINFALL HAS OCCURRED IN MOST 
PLACES.  THE DROUGHT MONITOR CLASSIFIES DROUGHT WITHIN ONE OF THESE 
FIVE CATEGORIES:

1) ABNORMALLY DRY
2) MODERATE
3) SEVERE
4) EXTREME
5) EXCEPTIONAL

A NORMAL TO ABOVE AVERAGE RAINFALL PATTERN HAS BEEN IN PLACE DURING 
THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH SCATTERED TO LOCALLY NUMEROUS SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE AREA.  DURING THE PAST WEEK 
...JULY 11TH THROUGH JULY 18TH...MOST AREAS RECEIVED BETWEEN ONE 
HALF AND ONE AND A HALF INCHES OF RAIN...WITH LOCALLY GREATER 
AMOUNTS. THIS HAS PROVIDED SOME MUCH NEEDED RELIEF FOR AREA LAWNS 
AND GARDENS. AVERAGE RAINFALL EXPECTED FOR JULY IS 4.50 AND 5.50 
INCHES. SO FAR THIS MONTH RAINFALL TOTALS HAVE AVERAGED BETWEEN 2 
AND 4 INCHES ACROSS MUCH OF CENTRAL ALABAMA...WITH VERY LOCALIZED 
TOTALS OF 5 TO 7 INCHES.  HOWEVER...A FEW LOCATIONS HAVE ONLY 
RECEIVED FROM 1 TO 2 INCHES FOR THE MONTH.

SOME PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS FOR CENTRAL ALABAMA SINCE JANUARY 1:

BIRMINGHAM   14.62 
MONTGOMERY   17.80 
ANNISTON     11.02 
TUSCALOOSA   12.60 
CALERA,      13.78 
TROY         22.33 

AVERAGE PRECIPITATION EXPECTED AND DEPARTURE FROM NORMAL FROM
JANUARY 1ST THROUGH JULY 12TH:

BIRMINGHAM, 32.05  DOWN 17.43 
MONTGOMERY  32.71  DOWN 14.91
ANNISTON    32.29  DOWN 21.27
TUSCALOOSA  34.40  DOWN 21.80

AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS...
LOW SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT REMAINS A MAJOR PROBLEM ACROSS CENTRAL 
ALABAMA BUT SOME TEMPORARY IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN NOTED DURING THE 
PAST WEEK. HOWEVER...THE MAJORITY OF NORTH CENTRAL ALABAMA SOILS 
REMAIN EXTREMELY DRY WITH SOIL MOISTURE PERCENTILES IN THE 10 
PERCENT OR LOWER OF NORMAL RANGE.

THERE HAS BEEN SOME SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS 
DURING THE PAST WEEK...BUT SERIOUS EFFECTS ARE STILL OCCURRING FROM 
THE DROUGHT.  THE WORST AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS ARE BEING FELT WITHIN 
THE CORN CROPS WITH THE USDA REPORTING 82 PERCENT OF THE ALABAMA 
CORN CROP IN POOR OR VERY POOR CONDITION.   ACCORDING TO THE 
USDA...SOME OTHER PERCENTAGES OF POOR AND VERY POOR CONDITIONS 
INCLUDE: 

    COTTON.....55 PERCENT
    SOYBEANS...66 PERCENT
    PEANUTS....38 PERCENT
    LIVESTOCK..63 PERCENT
    PASTURE....68 PERCENT

MOST LOCATIONS IN CENTRAL ALABAMA ARE EITHER LOW OR COMPLETELY OUT 
OF HAY...WITH RECENT AND FORECASTED RAINS OFFERING HOPE OF ANOTHER 
CUT IN THE COMING WEEKS. RECENT RAINS HAVE GREENED HAYFIELDS 
UP...AND PRODUCERS ARE EXPECTED TO GET A DECENT CUTTING OF HAY IF 
THE CURRENT RECENT PATTERN PERSISTS. HOWEVER...ALL COUNTIES IN 
CENTRAL ALABAMA HAVE BEEN DECLARED NATURAL DISASTER AREAS.

FIRE DANGER IMPACTS...
THE FIRE DANGER RISK REMAINS HIGH ACROSS CENTRAL ALABAMA BUT HAS 
IMPROVED SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE RECENT RAINFALL. THE KEETCH-BYRAM 
DROUGHT INDICES (KBDI)...ARE CURRENTLY IN THE 400 TO 500 RANGE 
ROUGHLY EAST OF A LINE FROM VERNON TO CENTREVILLE TO HAYNEVILLE. TO 
THE WEST OF THIS LINE INDICES ARE NOW IN THE 300 TO 400 RANGE. TO 
DATE...OVER 70000 ACRES HAVE BURNED IN ALABAMA. REPORTS SHOW THAT 
AREA TREE FARMS ARE HAVING SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN THE NORTHERN HALF 
OF THE STATE WITH NEW PLANTING SURVIVAL RATES AT 63 PERCENT. AVERAGE 
SURVIVAL RATE IS NEAR 85 PERCENT. THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS OF A 
SOUTHERN PINE BEETLE OUTBREAK.

HOWEVER...NOT ALL NEWS IS BAD. DUE TO THE RECENT RAINS...THE ALABAMA 
FORESTRY COMMISSION HAS REMOVED THE DROUGHT EMERGENCY ACROSS ALABAMA 
AND REPLACED IT WITH A FIRE ALERT FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
STATE. AREAS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF ALABAMA ARE NO LONGER 
WITHIN ANY FIRE RESTRICTIONS.

HYDROLOGIC IMPACTS...
OVER THE PAST 7 TO 10 DAYS THERE HAS BEEN SOME SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN 
AREA STREAM FLOWS ACROSS CENTRAL ALABAMA...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH 
AND WEST SECTIONS.  THIS IMPACT WAS MAINLY WITHIN THE SMALLER 
STREAMS AND CREEKS.  HOWEVER...THESE FLOWS WILL QUICKLY DECREASE IF 
ADDITIONAL RAINFALL DOES NOT OCCUR.

AREA RIVERS AND RESERVOIRS CONTINUE TO RUN BELOW TO MUCH BELOW
NORMAL AND SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACTS ARE INCREASING.  MOST STREAM
FLOWS WITHIN THESE LARGER SYSTEMS ARE AT OR NEAR RECORD LOW LEVELS
WITH RECENT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVING LITTLE TO NO IMPACT.
AREA RESERVOIR OPERATORS INDICATE THAT POOL LEVELS ON MANY
RESERVOIRS ARE APPROACHING WINTER POOL LEVELS.

SOCIAL IMPACTS...
AS WE CONTINUE INTO THE PEAK SEASON FOR RECREATIONAL WATER USAGE
ACROSS CENTRAL ALABAMA...DROUGHT CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO IMPACT AREA
WATER SUPPLIES. THE NUMBER OF MANDATORY AND VOLUNTARY WATER
RESTRICTIONS REMAINS STEADY. FINES AND SURCHARGES FOR EXCESSIVE
WATER USAGE ARE BEING ENFORCED IN MANY AREAS DUE TO THE SEVERE
DROUGHT CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE SOME REPORTS IN RURAL AREAS OF
CITIZENS RUNNING COMPLETELY OUT OF WATER AS WELL AS ONE STATE PARK
HAVING TO SHUT DOWN PART OF ITS SERVICES DUE TO NO WATER. AREA WATER
RESTRICTIONS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IF BENEFICIAL RAINS DO NOT
OCCUR.


OUTLOOK...
THE FORECAST FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY CALLS FOR SCATTERED TO 
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO IMPACT ALABAMA AS A COLD FRONT 
MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. RAINFALL TOTALS SHOULD AVERAGE BETWEEN ONE 
QUARTER AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER TOTALS 
POSSIBLE. 

THE MEDIUM RANGE FORECAST...FOR JULY 24TH THROUGH AUGUST 1ST...CALLS 
FOR BELOW NORMAL TO NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND NEAR AVERAGE 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES.

THE LONG RANGE OUTLOOK...FOR AUGUST THROUGH OCTOBER...CALLS 
FOR ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AND NEAR AVERAGE PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES.

...UPDATE STATEMENT...
THE NEXT DROUGHT INFORMATION STATEMENT WILL BE ISSUED AROUND JULY
27TH...OR EARLIER IF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CURRENT DROUGHT
SITUATION OCCUR.
