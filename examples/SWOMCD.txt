AREAS AFFECTED...SERN SD...FAR NERN NEB

CONCERNING...SEVERE POTENTIAL...WATCH UNLIKELY 

VALID 110026Z - 110200Z

PROBABILITY OF WATCH ISSUANCE...20 PERCENT

SUMMARY...ISOLATED THREAT FOR LARGE HAIL WILL EXIST THIS
EVENING...PARTICULARLY WITH A SMALL SUPERCELL MOVING SEWD ACROSS
HUTCHINSON COUNTY IN SERN SD AT 0010Z. THREAT IS EXPECTED TO BE TOO
LOCAL IN NATURE TO JUSTIFY A WW...BUT TRENDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE
MONITORED.

DISCUSSION...MESOANALYSIS AT 00Z SHOWED A STATIONARY FRONTAL
BOUNDARY EXTENDING WNWWD FROM NERN NEB INTO SRN SD. SURFACE
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S ARE MAXIMIZED ALONG AND N OF THE
BOUNDARY...BUT SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE FAIRLY COOL /60S TO MID
70S/. NEVERTHELESS...MUCAPE VALUES NEAR 1500 J/KG AND EFFECTIVE BULK
SHEAR AROUND 40 KT IS SUPPORTIVE OF ISOLATED SUPERCELL DEVELOPMENT
AND A THREAT FOR LARGE HAIL...AS OBSERVED OVER HUTCHINSON COUNTY IN
SERN SD AT 0010Z. THIS STORM IS MOVING SEWD AT 30 KT...AND WILL
REACH THE SD/NEB BORDER DURING THE NEXT 1-2 HOURS...WHERE OTHER
ELEVATED STORMS ARE ONGOING. POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL SUPERCELL
DEVELOPMENT APPEARS MARGINAL ATTM...THUS A WW DOES NOT CURRENTLY
APPEAR NECESSARY. LATER TONIGHT...LOW-LEVEL SLY JET WILL
STRENGTHEN...WITH THE EXIT REGION INTERACTING WITH A VERY MOIST AND
WEAK TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT. THIS WILL SUPPORT CONTINUED
STORM DEVELOPMENT...SOME OF WHICH COULD PRODUCE MARGINALLY SEVERE
HAIL...BUT MORE LIKELY HEAVY RAINFALL.
