...FLASH FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT CDT TONIGHT THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...

THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN PADUCAH HAS ISSUED A

* FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN ILLINOIS... 
  SOUTHWEST INDIANA...WESTERN KENTUCKY AND SOUTHEAST MISSOURI... 
  INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING AREAS...IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS... 
  ALEXANDER...EDWARDS...FRANKLIN...GALLATIN...HAMILTON... 
  HARDIN...JACKSON...JEFFERSON...JOHNSON...MASSAC...PERRY IL... 
  POPE...PULASKI...SALINE...UNION IL...WABASH...WAYNE IL...WHITE

  SOUTHEAST MISSOURI...BOLLINGER...BUTLER...CAPE GIRARDEAU...
  CARTER... MISSISSIPPI...NEW MADRID...PERRY MO...RIPLEY...
  SCOTT... STODDARD AND WAYNE MO. 

* FROM MIDNIGHT CDT TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON

* THE COMBINATION OF THE WIDE OPEN FLOW FROM THE GULF IN THE LOWER
  LEVELS AND A MONSOONAL FLOW FROM THE WEST ALOFT HAVE RESULTED IN
  AVAILABLE MOISTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND 200 PERCENT OF
  NORMAL. WITH NO TROPICAL SYSTEM INVOLVED THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL
  FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL IS EXPECTED EAST OF
  THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER...HOWEVER WEST OF THE RIVER PARTS OF
  SOUTHEAST MISSOURI HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED SEVERAL INCHES OF RAIN
  OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS. THEREFORE...THEY WERE INCLUDED IN THE
  WATCH. THE RAIN IS EXPECTED TO TAPER OFF LATE WEDNESDAY BUT
  RETURN THURSDAY AS COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION. THIS MAY
  RESULT IN THE WATCH BEING EXTENDED OR REISSUED LATER. 


* THIS COULD BE ESPECIALLY HAZARDOUS FOR SCHOOLS STARTING THIS
  WEEK WITH NEW AND UNFAMILIAR ROUTES FOR BUSES AND YOUNG
  MOTORISTS. HYDROPLANING WILL BE A MAJOR HAZARD DURING THIS
  EVENT. COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL IN STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WILL
  RAPIDLY REDUCE VISIBILITY AS WELL.

THE RAINFALL WILL BEGIN OVERNIGHT WHEN IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
DISCERN FLOODING AND PONDING ON AREA ROADWAYS. MOTORISTS ARE URGE
TO EXERCISE CAUTION AND NEVER DRIVE THROUGH FLOODED ROADS.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

A FLASH FLOOD WATCH MEANS THAT CONDITIONS MAY DEVELOP THAT LEAD
TO FLASH FLOODING. FLASH FLOODING IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.

YOU SHOULD MONITOR LATER FORECASTS AND BE PREPARED TO TAKE ACTION
SHOULD FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS BE ISSUED.
