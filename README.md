These are NWS product ingestors and processors.  Not sure how useful this is to
anybody else, but perhaps!  If you have questions, please let me know:

Feel free to do whatever you wish with these, including throwing them in the
trash.  Someday, I'll be a real programmer and write a libary that is usable.
